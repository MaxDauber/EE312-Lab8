********IF ATTEMPTING TO USE THIS PROGRAM READ THIS********
If you decide not to read this, you will not know how to use the code
So, I highly encourage you to read this.














Since you have now officially decided to read this READ_ME.txt,
I will now tell you how to use the program.

First. please place all the documents into a directory, e.g. a directory maybe named "sm_doc_set" or "big_doc_set" or "med_doc_set" ...

Next, please place this newly created directory of documents into the same directory that this READ_ME and program is placed into.

After you have done this, please make sure that this directory you are reading this READ_ME from, contains files called , main.cpp, hash.h and hash.cpp

Next, if it has these files then you can probably be sure that the code works, but if it does not work, make sure that these files have actual lines of code, because 
there could be a chance that they do not contain code and are empty files, if so, refer to the website cppreference.com and stack overflow on how to fill the files with
lines of code.

Now, you are certain they are not empty, please write the command "make", into the linux terminal

This should now compile the .cpp and .h files into an executable

This executable should be titled, plagiarismCatcher, you may want to check that this exists in your directory and if it does, YOU ARE ALMOST DONE!!!

Next in order to execute this file, please type into the terminal,  "./plagiarismCatcher path/to/files 6 200". The "path/to/files" will be the name of the directory or 
a path to the files.
In the above command, 6 represents the n-word chunks you are looking for, and 200 is the minimun number of collisions that you desire to report. 
YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE EITHER, BUT IT WILL CHANGE THE OUTPUT!!!

Now the code should output stuff, and this stuff is the results!!

CONGRATULATIONS!!! YOU HAVE EXECUTED THE CODE

thank you for reading this far, it really means a lot.
